# HANDOVER — `main` (important points only)

Updated 2026-10-30. Every feature branch has a detailed `HANDOVER.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Read those for the work in
that branch. This file keeps only what matters across the whole project.

## Goal
FutureReady MY is a career-planning app for Malaysia, built for the Domain 1 finalist round. A user builds a
**confirmed, structured profile** (from a CV or a form). Later modules use it: matching, learning roadmap, SDG and
scenario comparison.

## Modules on `main`
| Module | Branch (detailed docs there) | Merged | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| CV extraction and structured profile | `claude/cv-profile-module` | PR #1, `301c10e`, 2026-10-29 | Done; 179 tests pass; final review fixed |
| Search pickers, field of study, skill suggestions, career interests (owner requests) | `claude/cv-profile-module` | local merge, 2026-10-30 | Done; 229 tests pass; checked in the browser |
| Matching and the rest of the journey | not started | — | Next |

## Profile form since 2026-10-30 (owner requests)
- **Search as you type:** skills (O\*NET), roles of interest (O\*NET + eMASCO) and field of study (UNESCO
  ISCED-F 2013). Nothing is linked silently.
- **"Prefer not to say" is the default** of every optional field (a dropdown, no checkbox). Skill level starts on
  "Not assessed yet".
- **Field of study → O\*NET** through official tables only: ISCED-F → CIP (Statistics Canada) → O\*NET jobs (O\*NET
  crosswalk). 118 of 124 fields reach O\*NET. Originals are kept in `data/isced/source/`.
- **Skills suggested from the field of study:** "typical of the field" (more common in its jobs than overall).
  They are click-to-add chips, never added automatically. This is not matching and gives no score.
- **"Career interests and fields"** is one list: the 41 O\*NET interest areas, several allowed.
  `preferredCareerFields` is gone; old profiles are converted.
- **Every list shows its source on screen.** The owner calls this highly important; keep it for anything new.
- **O\*NET interest-area values (1–7)** are marked "AI/Expert" by O\*NET (05/2026). They are kept for matching
  and not used yet.

## What is not switched on yet (needs the owner's keys or OK)
- **`ONET_API_KEY`:** live O\*NET search. Until then the lookup uses the bundled O\*NET 31.0 snapshot, marked
  "cached".
- **Cloudflare D1 (`D1_*`) and R2 (`R2_*`):** without them, accounts say "not available" and guests still work
  fully.
- **RunPod endpoints:** L3 skill matching and the AI re-read. Ask the owner to approve the price first. There is no
  Claude key either (`CV_LLM_BACKUP_KEY`).

## Commands
```bash
npm install
npm test          # expect 229 passed
npm start         # http://localhost:3200, reads .env if present (copy .env.example)
```

## Rules that apply to every branch
- **Branches:** one branch per feature. Each branch keeps a detailed `HANDOVER.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. On every merge
  to `main`, put only the important points into these two files.
- Follow the owner's architecture diagrams exactly. Add nothing they do not state, such as extra limits.
- Use no scoring method from the previous project. Don't use the `C:/Users/guiro/XH-Cat_Domain1` folder as a
  template.
- Ask the owner before anything paid, and before merge, push, PR or force-push.

## Repository
- `C:\Users\guiro\XH_Cat_Final`, GitHub `https://github.com/guirong0109/XH-Cat_MyFuture` (private).
- Branches: `main` and `claude/cv-profile-module`. `main` is also checked out as a worktree at
  `C:\Users\guiro\XH_Cat_Final-main`; merge there, since `git checkout main` fails in the first folder.
- Node ≥ 22.12 (built on 24.16.0), Python 3 for `pipeline/`.
